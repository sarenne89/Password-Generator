# Console-Finances

Week 4 Challenge - Javascript

## Description

In this weeks challenge, we had to manipulate a two-dimensional array of financial data in order to reproduce the required statistics for analysis. This included calculating:

    *The total number of months worth of data in the array
    *The overall total, gained by summing all numbers in the array
    *The month-to-month changes for each data set
    *The average of these changes month-to-month
    *The greatest month-to-month increase
    *The greatest month-to-month decrease
